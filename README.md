# News Site "Welcome to Ocean News"

A newssite about the ocean and its problems and challenges.  
The newssite is based on a grid layout. Flexbox is used to style the content of the newscards. The big news spans 4 columns in desktop, 2 in tablet and one in mobile size.
The small news are arranged in 4 columns on desktop, 2 columns on tablet and 1 column on mobile.
The navigation is a hamburger in tablet and mobile site and an regular nav bar in desktop format. 
The news span a max-width of 1400px.
Buttons are used to link out to a detailed newspage. Here I used an external source/link and did not create a subsite for each newspage.
